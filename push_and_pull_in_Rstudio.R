##this is a file to test the "push" function in Rstudio
------------------------------------
##I created a new folder (wd) for this project
##I "cloned" this file by creating a new project in Rstudio and choose "vision control"
##Enter the web link, project name and the new wd path in the pop up window in Rtudio
#now I see the existing files and can edit this project in my Rstudio
##I added a new script and wrote the following line:
##this is a file to test "push" function in Rtusio
#then I check the checkbox at upper right coner in front of my new file
##then "commit" my new file
##doing so, my new file is no longer showing on the upper right coner
##I then clicked "push" button
##now I come back to my Github, the file is successfully uploaded here
##I now am going to test if these text I just wrote will be updated in Rtudio

-------------------------------------
##I used "pull" button in Rtudio and can see all the new text I did in Github in my Rstudio
##I also checked "history" of my commits and see all the changes I made in the last 10 mins
##this file will be used for my future reference if I ever need to use Rtudio to edit projects I obtained from Github
